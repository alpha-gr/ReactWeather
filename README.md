# ReactWeather

ReactWeather is a simple React Native weather app that allows users to view real-time weather forecasts for various locations. It uses the OpenMeteo API to provide accurate and up-to-date data.\
The application was developed during my bachelor's thesis in Computer Engineering @ unibo.

## Features

- Display of current weather conditions
- Short- and long-term forecasts
- Ability to search for weather by location
- Simple and responsive interface, optimized for both mobile and desktop
- Dark and Light mode
